## AI Usage Summary

AI tools (Claude) were used during development for:

- Learning best practices for HTML structure and CSS organization
- Generating boilerplate code and understanding responsive design patterns
- Debugging and code review
- Documentation assistance

All AI-generated code was reviewed, understood, and modified to fit the project requirements. See [docs/ai-usage-report.md](docs/ai-usage-report.md) for detailed documentation.
